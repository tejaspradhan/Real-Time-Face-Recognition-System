# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-System
A Real Time Face Recognition system developed with Python and OpenCV using a Support Vector machines classifier


## STEPS :
1) Prepare dataset by flattening Images
2) Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset to reduce dimensions
3) Train the SVM classifier with this dataset of reduced features
4) Test with video camera
